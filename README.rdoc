This is the website for the Rensselaer Rocket Society! We're using Rails 4 for this application, so Ruby version 2.0 is reccomended.

The old RRS website was pretty terrible, so John and I decided to make a new one.

After making a new design, I decided to add a back end to enable non programmers to update content.

This is a very simple app, the most complicated part is the permissions/logins, which are mostly handled by Devise and CanCan.
